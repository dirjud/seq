seq : Hierarchical HDL Sequencer Generation
===========================================

Do you write HDL (Hardware Desciptive Language)? Are you tired of
programming and debugging complex state machines? Do you want a more
flexible framework for creating complex state machines that are easy
to change and parameterize? ``seq`` is a tool to address this issues.
It easily generates the HDL for state machines from a simple,
hierarchical specification.

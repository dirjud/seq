seq : Hierarchical HDL Sequencer Generation
===========================================

Do you write HDL (Hardware Desciptive Language)? Are you tired of
programming complex state machines? Do you want a more flexible
framework for creating complex state machines that are easy to change
and parameterize? ``seq`` is the tool for you then. You can easily
generate the HDL for state machines from a simple specification.

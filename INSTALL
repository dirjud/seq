Installation Guide
==================

seq is a python application, and as such you will first need to install
Python (http://www.python.org).

From a Unix world, you can then run::

  make build
  sudo make install

From a Windows world that does not have make, run::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install


Then can write your specifications and generate your HDL using
python. See the examples in the examples directory and in the
documentation.
